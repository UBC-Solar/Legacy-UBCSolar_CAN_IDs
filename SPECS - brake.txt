Specs - Brake node

The brake node detects whether the brake is depressed and reports the brake status over CAN.

- When the brake is depressed, the brake node shall send a brake message (ID=0) with a one byte payload containing the value 1.

- When the brake is released, the brake node shall send a brake message (ID=0) with a one byte payload containing the value 0.

As the brake is a critical component of the system, it should be robust against packet loss.

- As such, the brake node shall repeat the "brake on" message roughly every 25ms while the brake is depressed. 

- After the brake is released, the brake node shall repeat the "brake off" message every 25ms for a duration of 250ms.
