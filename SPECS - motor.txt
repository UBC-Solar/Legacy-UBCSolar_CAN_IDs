Specs - Motor node

The motor node receives motor control messages and brake status messages and translates them for the motor-controller's analogue interface with accordingly. It also doubles as a speed sensing node.

- When the motor node receives a motor control message (ID=4), it shall:
  - immediately set the throttle potentiometer to the value indicated by the first byte in the message unless the direction indicated by the message is different from the current direction.
  - immediately set the regen potentiometer to the value indicated by the second byte in the message
  - if the direction indicated by the message is different from the current direction:
    1. if the current acceleration is not zero, start ramping down the throttle potentiometer until it is zero
    2. once the acceleration is zero, switch the motor direction
    3. ramp the acceleration back up to the value indicated by the message

- When the motor node receives a brake status message indicating the brake is depressed, it shall immediately set the acceleration to zero.

- If the motor node has not received a motor control message for more than 500ms, it shall assume a connection failure and immediately set the acceleration to zero

- The motor node shall report its speed reading at least once per 500ms or as soon as its speed reading updates.
